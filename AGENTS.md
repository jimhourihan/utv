# OpenUTV Developer & Agent Guide (`AGENTS.md`)

This document serves as an operational manual, architectural reference, and workflow guide for AI coding assistants and developers working on the OpenUTV codebase.

---

## 1. Development Environment & Commit Rules

### 1.1 GPG Signed Commits

All commits to the OpenUTV repository **must be GPG signed** (`git commit -S`).

- Local config key: `user.signingkey` is configured with an Ed25519 key (e.g. `Michael Oliver <mcoliver@gmail.com>`).
- Global/repo setting: `commit.gpgsign = true`.
- To verify a commit: `git log -1 --show-signature`.

### 1.2 Pre-Commit Hooks

Pre-commit checks are configured via `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

- **`cmake-format`**: Enforces CMake syntax and indentation.
- **`ruff-check`** & **`ruff-format`**: Python linting and formatting.
- **`clang-format`**: C/C++ formatting according to `.clang-format`.
- **`markdownlint`**: Markdown style rules according to `.markdownlint.yaml`.

#### Running Pre-Commit

- **Always run on staged files**:

  ```bash
  git add <modified-files>
  pre-commit run
  ```

- **Windows Caveat with Symlinks**:
  On Windows, git checkouts with `core.symlinks = false` check out repository symlinks (such as `src/lib/mu/MuQt6/qt2mu.py` or other Mu scripts) as plaintext pointer files.
  - Avoid running `pre-commit run --all-files` directly on Windows, as Ruff will parse these symlink text files as invalid Python scripts and attempt to reformat them.
  - Run `pre-commit run` only on staged files before committing.

### 1.3 Multi-OS Architecture & Cross-Platform Integrity

OpenUTV is a cross-platform desktop application targeting **macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel)**, **Windows (x64 MSVC)**, and **Linux (Ubuntu/glibc)**.

- **Universal Core Fixes**:
  - When fixing bugs or adding features (e.g. media loading, session serialization, OpenGL pipeline, shader compilation, UI event dispatch, menu synchronization), changes must resolve the root cause cleanly across all operating systems.
  - Never apply superficial OS-specific band-aids to core shared modules (`src/lib/ip`, `src/lib/app`, `src/lib/image`, etc.) when the defect is architectural.
- **Strict Isolation of Platform-Specific Behavior**:
  - If platform-specific functionality is strictly required (e.g. Apple event loops, Windows registry probing, POSIX signal handling, X11/Wayland display handling), it **MUST** be explicitly isolated behind platform preprocessor guards:
    - C++ preprocessor: `#ifdef PLATFORM_DARWIN`, `#ifdef PLATFORM_WINDOWS`, `#ifdef PLATFORM_LINUX`, or Qt macros `#if defined(Q_OS_MACOS)`, `#if defined(Q_OS_WIN)`, `#if defined(Q_OS_LINUX)`.
    - CMake build logic: `IF(APPLE)`, `IF(RV_TARGET_WINDOWS)`, `IF(RV_TARGET_LINUX)`.
    - Build scripts: separate shell/PowerShell blocks or platform conditionals.
  - Never introduce non-standard or platform-bound types (e.g. POSIX `ssize_t`) in shared headers without explicit fallback typedefs for MSVC/Windows (`#if defined(_MSC_VER) ...`).
- **Matrix Validation**:
  - All Pull Requests must build cleanly across the GitHub Actions CI matrix (`macOS`, `Windows`, `Linux`).

### 1.4 Patent-Encumbered Codecs: No x265 / HEVC Encoding in Distributed Binaries

OpenUTV **intentionally does not ship x265 (HEVC encoding)** in any binary we distribute, to avoid redistributing patent-encumbered codec implementations. This is a deliberate policy decision, not a gap to fix.

- **Where it's enforced**: in [`OpenUTV/utv-dependencies`](https://github.com/OpenUTV/utv-dependencies), `ports/openimageio/vcpkg.json` pulls in `libheif` with `"default-features": false`, so neither `libheif` nor OpenImageIO is built with x265 (commit `2845975`).
- **Known consequence**: libheif in the Windows build has no HEVC encoder, so OpenImageIO cannot write HEIC / HEIF (`.heic`, `.heif`, `.hif`) there. HEIC **reading** works (the Windows dependencies include the `libde265` decoder), and AVIF writing (AV1) is unaffected.
- **Do not**:
  - add x265, HEVC encoder plugins, or `libheif`/OpenImageIO features that pull them in to `utv-dependencies`, the build, or the installers;
  - "fix" HEIC/HEIF write failures by enabling HEVC encoding.
- **The "supercharged" FFmpeg can't provide HEIC encoding**: users get x265 by upgrading to `ffmpeg-full`, but libheif (used by OpenImageIO) only encodes HEVC through its own encoder plugins (x265, kvazaar). Its FFmpeg integration (`WITH_FFMPEG_DECODER`) is decode-only, and `ffmpeg-full` builds link x265 inside `avcodec` rather than as a loadable library. Don't try to route OIIO's HEIC encoding through the user's FFmpeg.
- **How HEIC export works instead** (no x265 shipped by us):
  - `IOoiio` test-encodes HEIC and AVIF when it loads and registers them as read-only if the encoder is missing, so nothing is advertised that cannot be written;
  - **macOS**: `IONSImage` writes HEIC through ImageIO with Apple's encoder (`IOoiio` keeps HEIC read-only on macOS);
  - **Windows**: `IOwic` writes HEIC through WIC with the encoder from Microsoft's "HEIF Image Extensions" and "HEVC Video Extensions" (Microsoft Store). Without them the write fails with a message naming what to install. `IOwic` always advertises Write because the formats cache is made on the build machine;
  - **Linux**: `IOoiio` writes HEIC when the user's libheif has an encoder.
- **Still acceptable, not implemented**: HEIC decoding through libheif's FFmpeg decoder plugin, using the user's FFmpeg.
- **macOS and Linux** link Homebrew's OpenImageIO/libheif, which include x265. Those are installed on the user's machine from Homebrew, not redistributed by us.
- Any change to this policy is a legal/licensing decision for the maintainers, not an engineering one.

### 1.5 macOS and Linux Link the User's Homebrew Libraries: No Bundling

`UTV.app` and the Linux build **intentionally do not bundle** Qt, FFmpeg, OpenColorIO, OpenImageIO and the other third-party libraries. They load them from the user's Homebrew. This keeps the download small and keeps us from redistributing other projects' binaries, including patent-encumbered codecs (see 1.4). This is a deliberate decision, not a gap to fix: do not propose bundling the libraries into the app.

- **Known consequence**: Homebrew upgrades libraries independently of UTV. An incompatible upgrade breaks the current release until a new one is built. OpenColorIO 2.5 -> 2.6 did this (#85): OCIO puts its version in every C++ symbol, so `UTV-bin` aborted in dyld before running any code. The same happens in reverse when a user installs a new UTV without upgrading their libraries.
- **How it is handled instead**:
  - the macOS launcher (`src/bin/nsapps/UTV/UTVLauncher.mm`) starts `UTV-bin -version` before the real launch and, if dyld fails, shows which library does not match and the command that fixes it (`brew update && brew upgrade && brew upgrade --cask utv`);
  - `.github/workflows/homebrew-canary.yml` installs the current release from the tap every day with that day's Homebrew, checks that it starts, and opens an issue when it does not;
  - the fix for a break is a new release, which is built against the current libraries.

## 2. Architecture: Launching & Runtime Initialization

### 2.1 Windows Launchers (`utv.exe` and the console launcher)

Full reference: [`docs/architecture/windows_runtime_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/windows_runtime_architecture.md).

- A release zip must work when extracted anywhere; `scripts/install.ps1` only adds convenience (OpenUTVDeps install, `<install>\cmd` on `PATH`, shortcuts, *Installed Apps*). Never write `PYTHONHOME`, `QT_PLUGIN_PATH` or dependency directories to the user or system environment.
- `src/bin/apps/rv/UTVLauncherWin.cpp` builds two launchers: `utv.exe` (GUI subsystem, also `rv.exe`) for the viewer, and `utv-cli-launcher.exe` (console subsystem). `cmake/install/post_install_windows.cmake` installs every program in `bin` as `<name>-bin.exe` behind a copy of the console launcher, adds the legacy `rv*` names as launchers, and copies all launchers into `cmd`.
- Command line tools must sit behind the **console** launcher: a GUI-subsystem launcher in front of a console tool loses the exit code in shells and opens a visible console window when the caller has none (the console flashes of #58).
- The launchers find the OpenUTVDeps release pinned in `cmake/openutv-deps-version.txt` (`UTV_DEPS_ROOT` first, then *Installed Apps* entries, `OPENUTV_DEPS_ROOT`, `Program Files`), refuse other releases with a message naming the one to install, set `PATH`/`PYTHONHOME`/Qt variables for their own process only, start the program in a kill-on-close job with `SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS`, and return its exit code. They never write to the installation directory.
- The viewer starts helper programs (`utvio` thumbnails, `py-interp`) as `<name>-bin.exe` directly: `QTBundle::executableFile()` prefers them.

### 2.2 OpenGL: GPU Driver or Mesa, per Process

- `bin\opengl32.dll` is a forwarder (`src/bin/apps/rv/opengl32/`) with the exports of the Windows `opengl32.dll`. It forwards to `System32\opengl32.dll` (the GPU driver) or, with `UTV_OPENGL=software`, to Mesa llvmpipe from OpenUTVDeps (PySide6's `opengl32sw.dll`).
- The launchers of OpenGL programs set `UTV_OPENGL` from a WGL probe: software when the renderer is "GDI Generic" (no GPU driver: Hyper-V, VirtualBox without 3D, RDP without a GPU) or older than OpenGL 2.1, or when forced with `--software-gl` / `UTV_SOFTWARE_GL=1`. Child processes inherit the decision.
- `utv-bin.exe` and `utvio-bin.exe` export `NvOptimusEnablement` / `AmdPowerXpressRequestHighPerformance` so hybrid-GPU laptops use the discrete GPU.

### 2.3 One OpenGL Implementation per Process (`QT_OPENGL=desktop`)
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Never set `QT_OPENGL=software` on Windows, and never ship Mesa as `bin\opengl32.dll`.**
> With `QT_OPENGL=software`, Qt's `qwindows.dll` loads `opengl32sw.dll` while OpenUTV and GLEW use `opengl32.dll`: two OpenGL implementations in one process, unrelated contexts, and a black viewport.
>
> The launchers set `QT_OPENGL=desktop`, so Qt loads `opengl32.dll` by name and gets the forwarder, like everything else in the process. Select software rendering with `UTV_OPENGL=software`.

### 2.4 Hardened Logging Subsystem (`FileLogger.cpp`)

- OpenUTV uses `spdlog` for file and console logging (`src/lib/app/RvCommon/FileLogger.cpp`).
- **Crash Prevention**:
  - `spdlog::basic_logger_mt` / `spdlog::details::file_helper::open` throws an unhandled `spdlog_ex` if the target directory does not exist or if user paths contain non-ASCII characters or network redirections.
  - Always pre-create the log directory (`%APPDATA%/OpenUTV/Logs` on Windows) using `QDir().mkpath()` *before* initializing the sink.
  - Always wrap `spdlog` creation in a `try / catch (const std::exception& e)` block, falling back gracefully to console/stderr.
  - Null-guard every call on `m_logger` (`if (m_logger) m_logger->info(...)`).

### 2.5 Native File Dialogs & Sequence Loading

- OpenUTV defaults to native OS file dialogs (`useNativeFileDialog = 1` in `Options.cpp` and fallback `true` in `MuUICommands.cpp`).
  - macOS uses `NSOpenPanel` (Finder).
  - Windows uses `IFileOpenDialog` (Windows Explorer).
- **Directory Loading**:
  - Added **File > Open Directory...** (`Ctrl+Shift+O` / `Cmd+Shift+O`).
  - Selecting directories in the file picker invokes unified sequence unpacking to load all image sequences and media within the folder recursively.

### 2.6 macOS Notarization, Hardened Runtime & Codesigning Order

- When Python wheels are installed via `requirements.txt` into `UTV.app/Contents/lib/python3.14/site-packages`, packages such as `opencolorio` bundle standalone CLI binaries under `PyOpenColorIO/bin/` (e.g. `ociocpuinfo`, `ocioconvert`).
- **Apple Notarization Requirement**: Apple's Notary Service scans *every* Mach-O binary in the entire `.zip` archive. Unsigned CLI binaries or binaries missing a secure timestamp / hardened runtime will cause notarization rejection.
  - OpenUTV only requires the in-process Python C-extension (`import PyOpenColorIO as OCIO`); the standalone CLI binaries are unnecessary inside the GUI application bundle.
  - `build.sh` and `build-and-release.yml` explicitly purge `bin/` directories inside `Contents/lib/**/site-packages/`.
- **Hardened Runtime & Library Validation (`com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`)**:
  - OpenUTV on macOS dynamically links against third-party and Homebrew libraries (such as Qt 6 in `/opt/homebrew`).
  - Under Hardened Runtime (`--options runtime`), macOS dyld will reject loading non-Apple dylibs unless the process holds the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement (defined in `src/bin/nsapps/UTV/entitlements.plist`).
  - **Critical Signing Rule**: ALL executables in `Contents/MacOS` (especially `UTV-bin` and the `UTV` launcher) MUST be signed with `--entitlements "$ENTITLEMENTS"`.
  - Any generic sweep to sign remaining Mach-O binaries in the bundle MUST prune `$APP_PATH/Contents/MacOS` (`find ... -path "$APP_PATH/Contents/MacOS" -prune -o ...`) so that `codesign --force` without entitlements NEVER touches or overwrites `UTV-bin`. Overwriting `UTV-bin` without entitlements immediately breaks dyld library loading on user machines with `EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT) / code signature not valid for use in process`.
- **Strict Signing Order**:
  1. Helper apps (`Contents/Helpers/*.app`)
  2. Frameworks (`Contents/Frameworks/*.framework`)
  3. Dynamic libraries and Python C-extensions (`*.dylib`, `*.so`)
  4. PlugIns subcomponents (`Contents/PlugIns`)
  5. Any remaining Mach-O binaries in `Contents` *outside* `Contents/MacOS`
  6. All executables in `Contents/MacOS` (`UTV-bin`, `UTV`) WITH `--entitlements "$ENTITLEMENTS"`
  7. Outer bundle (`UTV.app`) WITH `--entitlements "$ENTITLEMENTS"`

### 2.7 Homebrew Dynamic Link Sanitization & Symlink Normalization

- **Mach-O `LC_ID_DYLIB` Behavior**:
  - macOS linkers (`ld64`/`dyld`) do not record the filename given on the command line; they copy the library's embedded install name (`LC_ID_DYLIB`).
  - Homebrew formulas like OpenJPH (`openjph`) set their `LC_ID_DYLIB` to a versioned path (e.g. `/opt/homebrew/opt/openjph/lib/libopenjph.0.31.dylib`).
  - Whenever Homebrew upgrades the package (e.g. from 0.31 to 0.32), the older dylib file is deleted from the user's system, causing plugins like `mio_ffmpeg.dylib` and `io_htj2k.dylib` to fail loading at runtime (`Library not loaded: libopenjph.0.31.dylib (no such file)`).
- **Automated Normalization (`sanitize_homebrew_links.py`)**:
  - `src/build/sanitize_homebrew_links.py` is invoked during `build.sh` and before codesigning in `build-and-release.yml`.
  - It uses `install_name_tool -change` to rewrite Cellar paths to `/opt/homebrew/opt/...`.
  - For OpenJPH, it automatically maps any versioned link (`libopenjph.*.dylib`) to the unversioned symlink `/opt/homebrew/opt/openjph/lib/libopenjph.dylib`. Because Homebrew always maintains this symlink to the currently installed version, OpenUTV remains compatible across Homebrew updates without crashing.

## 3. CI/CD Architecture & Release Workflow

### 3.1 Conventional Commits & Branch Strategy

All contributions to OpenUTV must follow the **Conventional Commits** specification:

```text
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

- **Supported Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `docs`, `build`, `ci`, `test`, `chore`, `style`, `refactor`.
- **Enforcement**:
  - All Pull Requests must use conventional PR titles and commit messages.
  - Automated PR checking is enforced via `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` using `commitlint` with configuration in [`.commitlintrc.js`](.commitlintrc.js).
  - Merges to `main` must occur via Pull Requests to ensure clean semantic history and commitlint validation.

### 3.2 Automated Workflows Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of 7 modular workflows:

1. **`pr-checks.yml`** (Pull Requests):
   - Validates PR title and every commit message against Conventional Commits.
   - Executes pre-commit hooks (Python/Ruff, clang-format, cmake-format, markdownlint).
   - Validates build script syntax when code changes occur.
2. **`dev-build.yml`** (Merges to `main`):
   - Triggered on code path changes to `main` (`src/`, `cmake/`, `build.sh`, etc.).
   - Compiles and packages macOS, Windows, and Linux.
   - Applies full Apple Developer ID codesigning and Apple Notary Service notarization.
   - Updates the rolling `dev-build` pre-release tag in-place without generating email notifications to repository watchers.
   - Automatically generates a categorized changelog of commits since the last stable release.
3. **`branch-build.yml`** (Feature Branches):
   - Triggers on pushes to any branch in `OpenUTV/utv` (excluding forks).
   - Builds ad-hoc test binaries for macOS, Windows, and Linux and uploads them as Actions artifacts for QA testing before opening a PR.
4. **`release.yml`** (Production Release):
   - Triggered via `workflow_dispatch`.
   - Execution order: **Lint -> Determine Version -> Build (macOS/Win/Linux) -> Sign & Notarize -> Publish Release**.
   - Generates release checksums (`checksums.sha256`).
   - Automatically generates release notes categorized by Conventional Commit types (`scripts/generate-changelog.sh`).
5. **`publish-packages.yml`** (Triggered on Release Publication):
   - Automatically pushes cask updates to `OpenUTV/homebrew-utv`.
   - **Paused** (`if: false`): the Scoop (`OpenUTV/scoop-utv`), winget (`microsoft/winget-pkgs`) and Chocolatey jobs. Those packages are not maintained for now; `install.ps1` and the release zip are the supported Windows installs. Don't fix or re-enable them without the maintainers deciding to.
6. **`codeql.yml`**:
   - Weekly scheduled CodeQL security scanning for C++ and Python vulnerabilities.
7. **`dependabot-auto-merge.yml`**:
   - Automatically reviews and merges patch-level dependency updates.

### 3.3 Triggering a Production Release

To trigger a release build using the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml -f create_release=true -f version_override=2026.8
```

Options for `release.yml`:

- `version_override`: Optional custom version (e.g. `2026.8`). If left empty, CI automatically increments the minor version based on the latest git tag.
- `create_release`: Set to `true` to publish the GitHub release and trigger `publish-packages.yml`. Set to `false` for a dry-run test build.
- `platforms`: Choice of `all`, `macos-only`, `windows-only`, or `linux-only`.

### 3.4 Package Manager Secrets & Configuration

The package publishing pipeline requires the following per-service repository secrets:

| Secret | Purpose | Permissions / Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` | Updates `OpenUTV/homebrew-utv` | GitHub PAT with `repo` scope |
| `SCOOP_BUCKET_TOKEN` | Updates `OpenUTV/scoop-utv` | GitHub PAT with `repo` scope |
| `WINGET_PAT` | Submits PR to `microsoft/winget-pkgs` | GitHub PAT with `public_repo` scope |
| `CHOCO_API_KEY` | Pushes to Chocolatey Community Repository | API key from `community.chocolatey.org` |
| `GH_TOKEN_DEPS_READ` | Accesses private vendor SDKs | GitHub PAT with `repo:read` scope |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE` | Developer ID Application certificate (Base64) | Apple Developer Program |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PWD` | Password for macOS certificate `.p12` | - |
| `APPLE_API_KEY` | App Store Connect API Key (Base64) | Apple Notary Service API |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` | App Store Connect Key ID | Apple Notary Service API |
| `APPLE_API_ISSUER` | App Store Connect Issuer UUID | Apple Notary Service API |

### 3.5 One-Time Windows Package Manager Registration Scripts

> Paused along with the Scoop, winget and Chocolatey publish jobs (3.2); kept for when they are reopened.

To bootstrap package manager registrations, execute the provided setup scripts on a Windows machine:

1. **Scoop**:

   ```powershell
   pwsh .\scripts\register-scoop.ps1 -Version "2026.7"
   ```

2. **winget**:

   ```powershell
   pwsh .\scripts\register-winget.ps1 -Version "2026.7" -Submit
   ```

3. **Chocolatey**:

   ```powershell
   pwsh .\scripts\register-chocolatey.ps1 -Version "2026.7" -ApiKey "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
   ```
