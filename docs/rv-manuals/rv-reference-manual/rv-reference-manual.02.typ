= Image Processing Graph <ref-ch-image-processing-graph>

The UI needs to communicate with the core part of #app\. This is done in two
ways: by calling special command functions (commands) which act directly on
the core (e.g. play() causes it to start playing), or by setting variables
in the underlying image processing graph which control how images will be
rendered.

Inside each session there is a _directed acyclic graph_ (DAG) which
determines how images and audio will be evaluated for display. The DAG is
composed of _nodes_ which are themselves collections of _properties_.

A node is something that produces images and/or audio as output from images
and audio inputs (or no inputs in some cases). An example from #app is the
_color_ node; the color node takes images as input and produces images that
are copies of the input images with the hue, saturation, exposure, and
contrast potentially changed.

A _property_ is a state variable. The node's properties as a whole determine
how the node will change its inputs to produce its outputs. You can think of
a node's properties as _parameters_ that change its behavior.

#app's session file format (.rv file) stores all of the nodes associated
with a session including each node's properties. So the DAG contains the
complete state of #a-app session. When you load an .rv file into #app, you
create a new DAG based on the contents of the file. Therefore, _to change
anything in #app that affects how an image looks, you must change a property
in some node in its DAG_.

There are a few commands which #app provides to get and set properties:
these are available in both Mu and Python.

Finally, there is one last thing to know about properties: they are arrays
of values. So a property may contain zero values (it's empty) or one value
or an array of values. The get and set functions above all deal with arrays
of numbers even when a property only has a single value.

#xref(<ref-ch-node-reference>)[Chapter 16] lists all properties and their
function for each node type.

== Top-Level Node Graph

When #app is started with e.g. two media (movies, file sequences) it will
create two top-level group nodes: one for each media source. These are
called RVSourceGroup nodes. In addition, there are four other top-level
group nodes created and one display group node for each output device
present on the system.

#figure(
    img("rv-reference-manual-2-rv-cxx-se-rv4-top-level-01.png"),
    caption: [Top-Level node graph when two sources are present.],
)

There is always a default layout (RVLayoutGroup), sequence
(RVSequenceGroup), and stack node (RVStackGroup) as well as a view group
node (RVViewGroup). The view group is connected to each of the active
display groups (RVDisplayGroup). There is only one input to the view group
and that input determines what the user is seeing in the image viewer. When
the user changes views, the view group input is switched to the node the
user wishes to see. For example, when the user looks at one of the sources
(not in a sequence) the view group will be connected directly to that source
group.

New top level nodes can be created by the user. These nodes can have inputs
of any other top level node in the session other than the view group and
display groups.

In the scripting languages, the nodes are referred to by internal name. The
internal name is not normally visible to the user, but is used extensively
in the session file. Most of the node graph commands use internal node names
or the name of the node's type.

== Group Nodes and Pipeline Groups

A group node is composed of multiple member nodes. The graph connectivity is
determined by the value of the group node's properties or it is fixed. Group
nodes can contain other group nodes. The member nodes are visible to the
user interface scripting languages and their node names are unique in the
graph. Nodes may only be connected to nodes that are members of the same
group. In the case of top level nodes they can be connected to other top
level nodes.

A pipeline group is a type of group node that connects its members into a
single pipeline (no branches). Every pipeline group has a string array
property called pipeline.nodes which determines the types of the nodes in
the pipeline and the order in which they are connected. Any node type other
than view and display group nodes can be specified in the pipeline.nodes
property.

Each type of pipeline group has a default pipeline. Except for the
RVLinearizePipelineGroup which has two nodes in its default pipeline all
others have a single node with the exception of the view pipeline which is
empty by default. By modifying the pipeline.nodes property in any of these
pipeline groups the default member nodes can either be swapped out, removed
completely, or additional nodes can be inserted.

For example, the following Python code will set the view pipeline to use a
user defined node called “FilmLook”:

#code-block(lang: "python", ```
setStringProperty("#RVViewPipelineGroup.pipeline.nodes", ["FilmLook"], True)
```)

== Source Group Node

The source group node (RVSourceGroup) has fixed set of nodes and three
pipeline groups which can be modified to customize the source color
management.

#figure(
    img("rv-reference-manual-3-rv-cxx-rv4-source-group-02.png"),
    caption: [Source Group Internals],
)

The source group takes no inputs. There is either an RVFileSource or an
RVImageSource node at the leaf position of the source group. A file source
contains the name of the media that is provided by the source. An image
source contains raw pixels of its media
(usually obtained directly from a renderer etc).

The source group is responsible for linearizing the incoming pixel data,
possibly color correcting it and applying a look, and holding per-source
annotation and transforms. Any of these operations can be modified by
changing property values on the member nodes of the source group.

Pixels are expected to be in the working space (normally linear) after
exiting the source group.

)

=== Progressive Source Loading

If you need to, #app can load sources asynchronously, also known as
progressive source loading. Progressive source loading is turned off by
default.

*Use one of these methods to enable asynchronous source loading:*

- With the command line argument: `-progressiveSourceLoading 1`
- With the environment variable: `RV_PROGRESSIVE_SOURCE_LOADING`
- Execute the following command in #a-app Python package:

#code-block(lang: "python", ```
from rv import commands as rvc
rvc.setProgressiveSourceLoading(True)
```)

#quote(block: true)[
    *Note:* `setProgressiveSourceLoading` affects the behaviour of the
    following scripting commands:
    - addSource()
    - addSources()
    - addSourceVerbose()
    - addSourcesVerbose()
]

When progressive source loading is disabled (default setting), the sources
are loaded synchronously. This creates the sequence of events:

+ before-progressive-loading
+ source-group-complete media 1
+ source-group-complete media 2
+ after-progressive-loading

When progressive source loading is enabled, #app loads the sources
asynchronously:

+ #app creates a movie placeholder in the graph called a movieProxie which
  has a default duration of 20 frames.
+ It dispatches the actual loading of the media as a work item to a pool of
  worker threads.
+ Once the media completes the loading operation, the movieProxie
  placeholder is replaced with the actual movie.

You can expect this sequence of events:

+ before-progressive-loading
+ before-progressive-proxy-loading
+ source-group-proxy-complete media\_1
+ source-group-proxy-complete media\_2
+ after-progressive-proxy-loading
+ source-group-complete media 1
+ source-group-complete media 2
+ after-progressive-loading

Enabling progressive source loading significantly increases the complexity
of scripting. Consider the following example:

#code-block(lang: "python", ```
rv.commands.addSource('/my/clip/1')
rv.commands.setFPS(60.00)
```)

- With progressive source loading disabled (default setting), the script
  behaves as expected: the source is loaded with a frame rate set at 60 fps.

- With progressive source loading enabled, the script doesn't behave as
  expected. While the source is loaded asynchronously, the frame rate is set
  temporarily to 60 fps. It's only once the source is completely loaded that
  the frame rate is set to the source's native rate.

`progressiveSourceLoading` returns the loading state of the current
progressive source.

=== Deleting a Source

When you allocate a new source with `addSource()`, or one of its variants
such as `addSourceVerbose()`, #app actually allocates a source group under
the hood but only returns the RVFileSource node. Using `deleteNode()` on the
returned RVFileSource node deletes the node but not the source group that
was created.

To properly delete a source, you must delete its associated source group by
using the following:

#code-block(lang: "python", ```
rv.commands.deleteNode(rv.commands.nodeGroup(<loaded_node>))
```)

If you prefer, you can instead clear all the sources from the current
session with `rv.commands.clearSession()`.

== View Group Node

The view group (RVViewGroup) is responsible for viewing transforms and is
the final destination for audio in most cases. The view group is also
responsible for rendering any audio waveform visualization.

Changing the view in #app is equivalent to changing the input of the view
group. There is only one view group in #a-app session.

The view group contains a pipeline into which arbitrary nodes can be
inserted for purposes of QC and visualization. By default, this pipeline is
empty (it has no effect).

    img("rv-reference-manual-4-rv-cxx-e-rv4-view-group-03.png"),

        [`prevViewNode()`], [void], [None], [Switch to the previous view in the view history (if there is one)],
    ),
    caption: [High level commands used to change the view group inputs],
)

== Sequence Group Node

The sequence group node causes its inputs to be rendered one after another
in time.

The internal RVSequence node contains an EDL data structure which determines
the order and possibly the frame ranges for its inputs. By default the EDL
is automatically created by sequencing the inputs in order from the first to
last with their full frame ranges. The automatic EDL function can be turned
off in which case arbitrary EDL data can be set including cuts back to a
single source multiple times.

Each input to a sequence group has a unique sub-graph associated with it
that includes an RVPaint node to hold annotation per input and an optional
retime node to force all input media to the same FPS.

#figure(
    img("rv-reference-manual-5-rv-cxx-rv4-sequence-group-04.png"),
    caption: [Sequence Group Internals],
)

== Stack Group Node

The stack group node displays its inputs on top of each other and can
control a crop per input in order to allow pixels from lower layers to be
seen under upper layers. Similar to a sequence group, the stack group
contains an optional retime node per input in order to force all of the
input FPS' to the same value.

Unlike the sequence group, the stack group's paint node stores annotation
after the stacking so it always appears on top of all images.

#figure(
    img("rv-reference-manual-6-rv-cxx-rv4-stack-group-05.png"),
    caption: [Stack Group Internals],
)

== Layout Group Node

The layout group is similar to a stack group, but instead of showing all of
its inputs on top of one another, the inputs are transformed into a grid,
row, column, or under control of the user (manually). Like the other group
nodes, there is an optional retime node to force all inputs to a common FPS.
Annotations on the layout group appear on top of all images regardless of
their input order.

#figure(
    img("rv-reference-manual-7-rv-cxx-rv4-layout-group-06.png"),
    caption: [Layout Group Internals],
)

== Display Group Node

There is one display group for each video device accessible to #app\. For
example in the case of a dual monitor setup, there would be two display
groups: one for each monitor. The display group has two functions: to
prepare the working space pixels for display on the associated device and to
set any stereo modes for that device.

By default the display group's pipeline uses an RVDisplayColor node to
provide the color correction. The user can use any node for that purpose
instead or in addition to the existing RVDisplayColor. For example, when
OpenColorIO is being used a DisplayOCIONode is used in place of the
RVDisplayColor.

For a given desktop setup with multiple monitors only one of the
RVDisplayGroups is active at a time: the one corresponding to the monitor
that #app's main window is on. In presentation mode, two RVDisplayGroups
will be active: one for #app's main window and one for the presentation
device. Each display group has properties which identify their associated
device.

Changes to a display group affect the color and stereo mode for the
associated device only. In order to make a global color change that affects
all devices, a node should be inserted into the view group's pipeline or
earlier in the graph.

#figure(
    img("rv-reference-manual-8-rv-cxx-rv4-display-group-07.png"),
    caption: [Display Group Internals],
)

== Addressing Properties

A full property name has three parts: the node name, the component name, and
the property name. These are concatenated together with dots like
_nodename.componentname.propertyname_. Each property has its own type which
can be set and retrieved with one of the set or get functions. You must use
the correct get or set function to access the property. For example, to set
the display gamma, which is part of the “display” node, you need to use
setFloatProperty() like so in Mu:

#code-block(lang: none, ```
setFloatProperty("display.color.gamma", float[] {2.2, 2.2, 2.2}, true)
```)

or in Python:

#code-block(lang: "python", ```
setFloatProperty("display.color.gamma",  [2.2, 2.2, 2.2], True)
```)

In this case the value is being set to 2.2.

#figure(
    img("rv-reference-manual-9-rv-cxx-rv4-prop-inactive-08.png"),
    caption: [Conceptual diagram of #app Image and Audio Processing Graph for a session with a single sequence of two sources. The default stack and layout are not included in this diagram, but would be present.],
) <ref-rv-pipeline-small>

In #a-app session, some node names will vary per the source(s) being
displayed and some will not. @ref-rv-pipeline-small shows a pipeline diagram
for one possible configuration and indicates which are per-source
(duplicated) and which are not.

At any point in time, a subset of the graph is active. For example if you
have three sources in a session and #app is in sequence mode, at any given
frame only one source branch will be active. There is a second way to
address nodes in #app: by their types. This is done by putting a hash (\#)
in front of the type name. Addressing by node type will affect all of the
currently active nodes of the given type. For example, a property in the
color node is exposure which can be addressed directly like this in Mu:

#code-block(lang: none, ```
color.color.exposure
```)

or using the type name like this:

#code-block(lang: none, ```
#RVColor.color.exposure
```)

When the “\#” type name syntax is used, and you use one of the set or get
functions on the property, only nodes that are currently active and which
are the first reachable of the given type will be considered. So in this
case, if we were to set the exposure using type-addressing:

#code-block(lang: none, ```
setFloatProperty("#RVColor.color.exposure", float[] {2.0, 2.0, 2.0}, true)
```)

or in Python:

#code-block(lang: "python", ```
setFloatProperty("#RVColor.color.exposure", [2.0, 2.0, 2.0], True)
```)

In sequence mode (i.e. the default case), only one RVColor node is usually
active at a time
(the one belonging to the source being viewed at the current frame). In
stack mode, the RVColor nodes for all of the sources could be active. In
that case, they will all have their exposure set. In the UI, properties are
almost exclusively addressed in this manner so that making changes affects
the currently visible sources only. See
@ref-active-nodes-in-the-image-processing-graph for a diagrammatic
explanation.

#figure(
    img("rv-reference-manual-10-rv-cx-rv4-prop-active-09.png"),
    caption: [Active Nodes in the Image Processing Graph],
) <ref-active-nodes-in-the-image-processing-graph>

The active nodes are those nodes which contribute to the rendered view at
any given frame. In this configuration, when the sequence is active, there
is only one source branch active (the yellow nodes). By addressing
properties using their node's type name, you can affect only active nodes
with that type without needing to search for the exact node(s).

There is an additional shorthand using “\@” in front of a type name:

#code-block(lang: none, ```
@RVDisplayColor.color.brightness
```)

The above would affect only the first RVDisplayColor node it finds instead
of all RVDisplayColor nodes of depth 1 like “\#” does. This is useful with
presentation mode for example because setting the brightness would be
confined to the first RVDisplayColor node which would be the one associated
with the presentation device. If “\#” was used, all devices would have their
brightness modified. The utility of the “\@” syntax is limited compared to
“\#” so if you are unsure of which to use try “\#” first.

#xref(<ref-ch-node-reference>)[Chapter 16] has all the details about each
node type.

== User Defined Properties

It's possible to add your own properties when creating #a-app file from
scratch or from the user interface code using the newProperty() function.

Why would you want to do this? There are a few reasons to add a user defined
property:

+ You wish to save something in a session file that was created
  interactively by the user.
+ You're generating session files from outside #app and you want to include
  additional information (e.g. production tracking, annotations) which you'd
  like to have available when #app plays the session file.

Some of the packages that come with #app show how to implement functionality
for the above.

== Getting Information From Images

#app's UI often needs to take actions that depend on the context. Usually
the context is the current image being displayed.
@ref-command-functions-for-querying-displayed-images shows the most useful
command functions for getting information about displayed images.

    ),
    caption: [Command Functions for Querying Displayed Images],
) <ref-command-functions-for-querying-displayed-images>

For example, when automating color management, the color space of the image
or the origin of the image may be required to determine the best way to view
the image
(e.g., for a certain kind of DPX file you might want to use a particular
display or file LUT).
The color space is often stored as image attribute. In some cases, image
attributes are misleading–for example, a well known 3D software package
renders images with incorrect information about pixel aspect ratio—usually
other information in the image attributes coupled with the file name and
origin are enough to make a good guess.
