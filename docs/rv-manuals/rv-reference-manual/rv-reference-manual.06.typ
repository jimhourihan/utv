= #app File Format <ref-ch-file-format>

The #app file format (#inline-shell(".rv")) is a text GTO file. GTO is an
open source file format which stores arbitrary data — mostly for use in
computer graphics applications. The text GTO format is meant to be simple
and human readable. It's helpful to have familiarized yourself with the GTO
documentation before reading this section. The documentation should come
with #app, or you can read it on line at the GTO.

== How #app Uses GTO

#app defines a number of new GTO object protocols (types of objects). The
GTO file is made up of objects, which contain components, which contain
properties where the actual data resides. #app's use of the format is to
store nodes in an image processing graph as GTO objects. How the nodes are
connected is determined by #app and is not currently arbitrary so there are
no connections between the objects stored in the file.

Some examples of #app object types include:

- The *RVSession* object (one per file) which stores information about the
  session. This includes the full frame range, currently marked frames, the
  playback FPS, and whether or not to use real time playback among other
  things.
- *RVLayoutGroup*, *RVFolderGroup, RVSwitchGroup, RVSourceGroup*,
  *RVRetimeGroup*, *RVStackGroup*, *RVDisplayGroup* and *RVSequenceGroup*
  nodes which form the top-level of the image processing graph.
- One or more *RVFileSource* objects each within an *RVSourceGroup* which
  specify all of the media (movies, audio files, image sequences) which are
  available in the session.
- Color correction objects like *RVColor* nodes which are members of
  *RVSourceGroup* objects.
- Image format objects like *RVFormat* or *RVChannelMap* which are also
  members of *RVSourceGroup* objects.
- An *RVDisplayColor* object (one per file) which indicates monitor gamma,
  any display LUT being used (and possibly the actual LUT data) which is
  part of the *RVDisplayGroup*.
- A *connections* object which contains connections between the top-level
  group nodes. The file only stores the top-level connections — connections
  within group nodes are determined by the group node at runtime.

Normally, #app will write out all objects to the session file, but it does
not require all of them to create a session from scratch. For example, if
you have a file with a single RVFileSource object in it, #app will use that
and create default objects for everything else. So when creating a file
without #app, it's not a bad idea to only include information that you need
instead of replicating the output of #app itself.
(This helps make your code future proof as well).

The order in which the objects appear in the file is not important. You can
also include information that #app does not know about if you want to use
the file for other programs as well.

== Naming

The names of objects in the session are not visible to the user, however
they must follow certain naming conventions. There is a separate user
interface name for top level nodes which the user does see. The user name
can be set by creating a string property on a group node called ui.name.

- If the object is a group node type other than a source or display group
  its name can be anything, but it must be unique.
- If there is an *RVDisplayGroup* in the file it must be called
  displayGroup.
- If the object is a member of a group its name should have the pattern:
  groupName\_nodeName where groupName is the name of the group the node is a
  member of. The nodeName can be anything, but #app will use the type name
  in lowercase without the “#app” at the front.
- If the object is a *RVFileSourceGroup* or *RVImageSourceGroup* it should
  be named sourceGroupXXXXXX where the Xs form a six digit zero padded
  number. #app will create source groups starting with number 000000 and
  increment the number for each new source group it creates. If a source
  group is deleted, #app may reuse its number when creating a new group.
- The *connection* object should be named connections.
- The *RVSession* object can have any name.

== A Simple Example

The simplest #app file you can create is one which just causes #app to load
a single movie file or image. This example loads a QuickTime file called
“test.mov” from the directory #app was started in:

#code-block(lang: none, ```
GTOa (3)

sourceGroup000000_source : RVFileSource (0)
{
    media
    {
        string movie =  "test.mov"
    }
}
```)

The first line is required for a text GTO file: it indicates the fact that
the file is text format and that the GTO file version is 3. All of the other
information (the frame ranges, etc) will be automatically generated when the
file is read. By default #app will play the entire range of the movie just
as if you dropped it into a blank #app session in the UI. You should name
the first *RVFileSource* object sourceGroup000000\_source and the second
sourceGroup000001\_source and the third sourceGroup000002\_source, and so
on. Eventually we'll want to make an EDL which will index the source objects
so the names mostly matter (but not the order in which they appear).

Now suppose we have an image sequence instead of a movie file. We also have
an associated audio file which needs to be played with it. This is a bit
more complicated, but we still only need to make a single *RVFileSource*
object:

#code-block(lang: none, ```
GTOa (3)

sourceGroup000000_source : RVFileSource (0)
{
    media
    {
        string movie = [ "test.#.dpx" "soundtrack.aiff" ]
    }

    group
    {
        float fps =  24
        float volume =  0.5
        float audioOffset = 0.1
    }
}
```)

Here we've got `test.#.dpx` as an image layer and `soundtrack.aiff` which is
an audio layer. You can have any number of audio and image sequence/movie
files in the movie list. All of them together create the output of the
*RVFileSource* object. If we were creating a stereo source, we might have
left.\#.dpx and right.\#.dpx instead of test.\#.dpx. When there are multiple
image layers the first two default to the left and right eyes in the order
in which they appear. You can change this behavior per-source if necessary.
The format of the various layers do not need to match.

The *group* component indicates how all of the media should be combined. In
this case we've indicated the FPS of the image sequence, the volume of all
audio for this source and an audio slip of 0.1 (one tenth) of a second. Keep
in mind that FPS here is for the image sequence(s) in the source it has
nothing to do with the playback FPS!. The playback FPS is independent of the
input sources frame rate.

=== Aside: What is the FPS of an RVFileSource Object Anyway?

If you write out #a-app file from #app itself, you'll notice that the group
FPS is often 0! This is a special cookie value which indicates that the FPS
should be taken from the media. Movie file formats like QuickTime or AVI
store this information internally. So #app will use the frame rate from the
media file as the FPS for the source.

However, image sequences typically do not include this information
(OpenEXR files are a notable exception). When you start #app from the
command line it will use the playback FPS as a default value for any sources
created. If there is no playback FPS on startup either via the command line
or preferences, it will default to 24 fps. So it's not a bad idea to include
the group FPS when creating #a-app file yourself when you're using image
sequences. If you're using a movie file format you should either use 0 for
the FPS or not include it and let #app figure it out.

What happens when you get a mismatch between the source FPS and the playback
FPS? If there's no audio, you won't notice anything; #app always plays back
every frame in the source regardless of the source FPS. But if you have
audio layers along with your image sequence or if the media is a movie file,
you will notice that the audio is either compressed or expanded in order to
maintain synchronization with the images.

This is a very important thing to understand about #app: it will always
playback every image no matter what the playback FPS is set to; and it will
always change the audio to compensate for that and maintain synchronization
with the images.

So the source FPS is really important when there is audio associated with
the images.

== Per-Source and Display Color Settings and LUT Files

If you want to include per-source color information – such as forcing a
particular LUT to be applied or converting log to linear – you can include
only the additional nodes you need with only the parameters that you wish to
pass in. For example, to apply a file LUT to the first source
(e.g. sourceGroup000000\_source) you can create an *RVColor* node similarly
named sourceGroup000000\_color.

#code-block(lang: none, ```
sourceGroup000000_color : RVColor (1)
{
    lut
    {
        string file = "/path/to/LUTs/log2sRGB.csp"
        int active = 1
    }
}
```)

This is a special case in the rv session file: you can refer to a LUT by
file. If you have a new-source event bound to a function which modifies
incoming color settings based on the image type, any node properties in your
session file override the default values created there. To state it another
way: values you omit in the session file still exist in #app and will take
on whatever values the function bound to new-source made for them. To ensure
that you get exactly the color you want you can specify all of the relevant
color properties in the *RVColor, RVLinearize,* and *RVDisplayColor* nodes:

#code-block(lang: none, ```
sourceGroup000000_colorPipeline_0 : RVColor (2)

The above example values assume default color pipeline slots for a single
source session. Please see #xref(<ref-ch-color-management>)[Chapter 12] to
learn more about the specific color pipeline groups.

== Information Global to the Session

Now let's add an *RVSession* object with in and output points. The session
object should be called rv in this version. There should only be one
*RVSession* object in the file.

#quote(block: true)[
    *Note:* From now on we're just going to show fragments of the file and
    assume that you can put them all together in your text editor.
]

#code-block(lang: none, ```
rv : RVSession (1)
{
    session
    {
        string viewNode = "defaultSequence"
        int marks = [ 1 20 50 80 100 ]
        int[2] range = [ [ 1 100 ] ]
        int[2] region = [ [ 20 50 ] ]
        float fps =  24
        int realtime =  1
        int currentFrame =  30
    }
}
```)

Assuming this was added to the top of our previous file with the source in
it, the session object now indicates the frame range (1-100) and an in and
out region (20-50) which is currently active. Frames 1, 20, 50, 80, and 100
are marked and the default frame is frame 30 when #app starts up. The
realtime property is a flag which indicates that #app should start playback
in real time mode. The view node indicates what will be viewed in the
session when the file is opened.

Note that it's usually a good idea to skip the frame range boundaries unless
an EDL is also specified in the file (which is not the case here). #app will
figure out the correct range information from the source media. If you force
the range information to be different than the source media's you may get
unexpected results. The marks and range can also be stored on each viewable
top-level object. For example the defaultLayout and defaultSequence can have
different marks and in and out points:

#code-block(lang: none, ```
defaultStack : RVStackGroup (1)
{
    session
    {
        float fps = 24
        int marks = [ ]
        int[2] region = [ [ 100 200 ] ]
        int frame = 1
    }
}
```)

If a group has a session component then the contents can provide an in/out
region, marks, playback fps and a current frame. When the user views the
group node these values will become inherited by the session.

== The Graph

Internally, #app holds a single image processing graph per session which is
represented in the session file. The graph can have multiple nodes which
determine how the sources are combined. These are the top-level nodes and
are always group nodes. The user can create new top-level nodes
(like sequences, stacks, layouts, retimings, etc). So the inputs for each
node need to be stored in order to reproduce what the user created. The
connections between the top-level group nodes are stored in the connections
object and includes a list of the top level nodes. For example, this is what
#app will write out for a session with a single source in it:

#code-block(lang: none, ```
connections : connection (1)
{
    evaluation
    {
        string lhs = [ "sourceGroup000000"
                       "sourceGroup000000"
                       "sourceGroup000000" ]

        string rhs = [ "defaultLayout"
                       "defaultSequence"
                       "defaultStack" ]
    }

    top
    {
        string nodes = [ "sourceGroup00000",
                         "defaultLayout",
                         "defaultStack",
                         "defaultSequence" ]
    }
}
```)

The connections should be interpreted as arrows between objects. The lhs
(left hand side) is the base of the arrow. The rhs (right hand side) is the
tip. The base and tips are stored in separate properties. So in the case,
the file has three connections:

#quote(block: true)[
    *Note:* #app may write out a connection to the display group as well.
    However, that connection is redundant and may be overridden by the value
    of the view node property in the RVSession.
]

+ sourceGroup000000 → defaultLayout
+ sourceGroup000000 → defaultSequence
+ sourceGroup000000 → defaultStack

The nodes property, if it exists, will determine which nodes are considered
top level nodes. Otherwise, nodes which include connections and nodes which
have user interface name are considered top level.

=== Default Views

There are three default views that are always created by #app: the default
stack, sequence, and layout. Whenever a new source is added by the user each
of these will automatically connect the new source as an input. When a new
viewing node is created (a new sequence, stack, layout, retime) the default
views will not add those —- only sources are automatically added.

When writing a .rv file you can co-opt these views to rearrange or add
inputs or generate a unique EDL but it's probably a better idea to create a
new one instead; #app will never automatically edit a sequence, stack,
layout, etc, that is not one of the default views.

== Creating a Session File for Custom Review

One of the major reasons to create session files outside of #app is to
automatically generate custom review workflows. For example, if you want to
look at an old version of a sequence and a new version, you might have your
pipeline output a session file with both in the session and have
pre-constructed stacked views with wipes and a side-by-side layout of the
two sequences.

To start with let's look at creating a session file which creates a unique
sequence (not the default sequence) which plays back sources in a particular
order. In this case, no EDL creation is necessary — we only need to supply
the sequence with the source inputs in the correct order. This is analogous
to the user reordering the inputs on a sequence in the user interface.

This file will have an RVSequenceGroup object as well as the sources.
Creating sources is covered above so we'll skip to the creation of the
RVSequenceGroup. For this example we'll assume there are three sources and
that they all have the same FPS (so no retiming is necessary). We'll let
#app handle creation of the underlying RVSequence and its EDL and only
create the group:

#code-block(lang: none, ```
// define sources ...

reviewSequence : RVSequenceGroup (1)
{
    ui { string name = "For Review" }
}

connections : connection (1)
{
    evaluation
    {
        string lhs = [ "sourceGroup000002"
                       "sourceGroup000000"
                       "sourceGroup000001" ]

        string rhs = [ "reviewSequence"
                       "reviewSequence"
                       "reviewSequence" ]
    }
}
```)

#app will automatically connect up the default views so we can skip their
inputs in the connections object for clarity. In this case, the sequence is
connected up so that by default it will play sourceGroup000002 followed by
sourceGroup000000 followed by sourceGroup000001 because the default EDL of a
sequence just plays back the inputs in order. Note that for basic ordering
of playback, no EDL creation is necessary. We could also create additional
sequence groups with other inputs. Also note the use of the UI name in the
sequence group.

Of course, the above is not typical in a production environment. Usually
there are handles which need to (possibly) be edited out. There are two ways
to do this with #app: either set the cut points in each source and tell the
sequence to use them, or create an EDL in the sequence which excludes the
handles.

To start with we'll show the first method: set the cut points. This method
is easy to implement and the sequence interface has a button on it that lets
the user toggle the in/out cuts on/off in realtime. If the user reorders the
sequence, the cuts will be maintained. When using this method any sequence
in the session can be made to use the same cut information — it propagates
down from the source to the sequence instead of being stored for each
sequence.

Setting the cut in/out points requires adding a property to the RVFileSource
objects and specifying the in and out frames:

#code-block(lang: none, ```
sourceGroup000000_source : RVFileSource (1)
{
    media { string movie = "shot00.mov" }

    cut
    {
        int in = 8
        int out = 55
    }
}

sourceGroup000001_source : RVFileSource (1)
{
    media { string movie = "shot01.mov" }

    cut
    {
        int in = 5
        int out = 102
    }
}

sourceGroup000002_source : RVFileSource (1)
{
    media { string movie = "shot02.mov" }

    cut
    {
        int in = 3
        int out = 22
    }
}
```)

Finally, the most flexible way to control playback is to create an EDL. The
EDL is stored in an RVSequence node which is a member of the
RVSequenceGroup. Whenever an RVSequenceGroup is created, it will create a
sequence node to hold the EDL. If you are not changing the default values or
behavior of the sequence node it's not necessary to specify it in the file.
In this case, however we will be creating a custom EDL.

=== RVSequence

The sequence node can be in one of two modes: auto EDL creation or manual
EDL creation. This is controlled by the mode.autoEDL property. If the
property is set to 1 then the sequence will behave like so:

- If a new input is connected, the existing EDL is erased and a new EDL is
  created.
- Each input of the sequence will have a cut created for it in the order
  that they appear. If mode.useCutInfo is set, the sequence will use the cut
  information coming from the input to determine the cut in the EDL.
  Otherwise it will use the full range of the input.
- If cut info changes on any input to the sequence, the EDL will be adjusted
  automatically.

When auto EDL is not on, the sequence node behavior is not well-defined when
the inputs are changed. In future, we'd like to provide more interface for
EDL modification (editing) but for the moment, a custom EDL should only be
created programmatically in the session file.

For this next example, we'll use two movie files: a.mov and b.mov. They have
audio so there's nothing interesting about their source definitions: just
the media property with the name of the movie. They are both 24 fps and the
playback will be as well:

#quote(block: true)[
    *Note:* The example #app file has fewer line breaks than one which #app
    would write. However, it's still valid.

        int source = [  0  1  0  1  0 ]
        int in     = [  1  1 11 11  0 ]
        int out    = [ 10 10 20 20  0 ]
    }

The source property indexes the inputs to the sequence node. So index 0
refers to sourceGroup000000 and index 1 refers to sourceGroup000001. This
EDL has four edits which are played sequentially as follows:

+ a.mov, frames 1-10
+ b.mov, frames 1-10
+ a.mov, frames 11-20
+ b.mov, frames 11-20

You can think of the properties in the sequence as forming a transposed
matrix in which the properties are columns and edits are rows as in
@ref-edl-as-matrix. Note that there are only 4 edits even though there are 5
rows in the matrix. The last edit is really just a boundary condition: it
indicates how #app should handle frames past the end of the EDL. To be well
formed, #a-app EDL needs to include this.

Note that the in frame and out frame may be equal to implement a “held”
frame.

=== RVLayoutGroup and RVStackGroup

The stack and layout groups can be made in a similar manner to the above.
The important thing to remember is the inputs for all of these must be
specified in the connections object of the file. Each of these view types
uses the input ordering; in the case of the stack it determines what's on
top and in the case of the layout it determines how automatic layout will be
ordered.

=== RVOverlay

Burned in metadata can be useful when creating session files. Shot status,
artist, name, sequence, and other static information can be rendered on top
of the source image directly by #app's render.
@ref-metadata-rendered-by-rvoverlay-node-from-session-file shows an example
of metadata rendered by the RVOverlay node.

#figure(
    img("rv-reference-manual-11-rv-cx-ase-overlay-shot-010.png"),
    caption: [Metadata Rendered By RVOverlay Node From Session File],
) <ref-metadata-rendered-by-rvoverlay-node-from-session-file>

Each RVSourceGroup can have an RVOverlay node. The RVOverlay node is used
for matte rendering by user interface, but it can do much more than that.
The RVOverlay node currently supports drawing arbitrary filled rectangles
and text in addition to the mattes. The text and filled rectangle are
currently limited to static shapes and text. Text and rectangles rendered in
this fashion are considered part of the image by #app\. If you pass a
session file with an active RVOverlay node to rvio it will render the
overlay the same way #app would. This is completely independent of any rvio
overlay scripts which use a different mechanism to generate overlay drawings
and text.@ref-rvoverlay-node-example shows an example which draws three
colored boxes with text starting at each box's origin.

) <ref-rvoverlay-node-example>

The session file used to create the example contains a movieproc source
(white 720x480 image) with the overlay rendered on top of it. Note that the
coordinates are normalized screen coordinates relative to the source image:

    {
        string movie = "solid,red=1.0,green=1.0,blue=1.0,start=1,end=1,width=720,height=480.movieproc"
    }
}

{
    overlay
    {
        int show = 1
    }
    "rect:red"
    {
        float width = 0.3
        float height = 0.3
        float[4] color = [ [ 1.0 0.1 0.1 0.4 ] ]
        float[2] position = [ [ 0.1 0.1 ] ]
    }
    "rect:green"
    {
        float width = 0.6
        float height = 0.2
        float[4] color = [ [ 0.1 1.0 0.1 0.4 ] ]
        float[2] position = [ [ -0.2 -0.3 ] ]
    }
    "rect:blue"
    {
        float width = 0.2
        float height = 0.4
        float[4] color = [ [ 0.1 0.1 1.0 0.4 ] ]
        float[2] position = [ [ -0.5 -0.1 ] ]
    }
    "text:red"
    {
        float[2] position = [ [ 0.1 0.1 ] ]
        float[4] color = [ [ 0 0 0 1 ] ]
        float spacing = 0.8
        float size = 0.005
        float scale = 1
        float rotation = 0
        string font = ""
        string text = "red"
        int debug = 0
    }
    "text:green"
    {
        float[2] position = [ [ -0.2 -0.3 ] ]
        float[4] color = [ [ 0 0 0 1 ] ]
        float spacing = 0.8
        float size = 0.005
        float scale = 1
        float rotation = 0
        string font = ""
        string text = "green"
        int debug = 0
    }
    "text:blue"
    {
        float[2] position = [ [ -0.5 -0.1 ] ]
        float[4] color = [ [ 0 0 0 1 ] ]
        float spacing = 0.8
        float size = 0.005
        float scale = 1
        float rotation = 0
        string font = ""
        string text = "blue"
        int debug = 0
    }
}
```)

Components in the RVOverlay which have names starting with “rect:” are used
to render filled rectangles. Components starting with “text:” are used for
text. The format is similar to that used by the RVPaint node, but the result
is rendered for all frames of the source. The reference manual contains
complete information about the RVOverlay node's properties and how the
control rendering.

== Limitations on Number of Open Files

#app does not impose any artificial limits on the number of source which can
be in #a-app session file. However, the use of some file formats, namely
Quicktime .mov, .avi, and .mp4, require that the file remain open while #app
is running.

Each operating system (and even shell on Unix systems) has different limits
on the number of open files a process is allowed to have. For example on
Linux the default is 1024 files. This means that you cannot open more than
1000 or so movie files without changing the default. #app checks the limit
on startup and sets it to the maximum allowed by the system.

There are a number of operating system and shell dependent ways to change
limits. Your facility may also have limits imposed by the IT department for
accounting reasons.

== What's the Best Way to Write a .rv (GTO) File?

GTO comes in three types: text (UTF8 or ASCII), binary, and compressed
binary. #app can read all three types. #app normally writes text files
unless an *RVImageSource* is present in the session
(because an image was sent to it from another process instead of a file). In
that case it will write a compressed binary GTO to save space on disk.

If you think you might want to generate binary files in addition to text
files you can do so using the GTO API in C++ or python. However, the text
version is simple enough to write using only regular I/O APIs in any
language. We recommend you write out .rv session files from #app and look at
them in an editor to generate templates of the portions that are important
to you. You can copy and paste parts of session files into source code as
strings or even shell scripts as templates with variable substitution.
