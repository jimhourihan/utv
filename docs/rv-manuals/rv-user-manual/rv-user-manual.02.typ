= Installation

Refer to the #app README to learn how to build and install #app.

If you're using network proxies or self-signed certificates, read on.

== Proxy Configuration

If your network uses a proxy server, you can configure #app to use it by
setting the following environment variables.

#table(
    columns: 4,
    align: left,
    table.header[*Environment variable*][*Type*][*Required?*][*Description*],
    `RV_NETWORK_PROXY_HOST`,     [string], [required], [Proxy host name or IP address],
    `RV_NETWORK_PROXY_PORT`,     [int],    [required], [Proxy port number],
    `RV_NETWORK_PROXY_USER`,     [string], [optional], [Username for proxy service],
    `RV_NETWORK_PROXY_PASSWORD`, [string], [optional], [Password for proxy service],
)

#quote(block: true)[
    *Note:* If you do not set a proxy, #app always uses the operating
    system's proxy. To have #app ignore all proxies (including the
    system's own), set the environment variable
    `RV_NETWORK_PROXY_DISABLE`.

== About Self-Signed Certificates and #app

#app uses QtWebEngine as a browser backend, built on top of Chromium.
Because of the Chromium backend, #app uses the system certificate store to
approve SSL certificates. If your studio uses a custom certificate on the
network path between #app and your media, you must make sure that the
Certificate Authority (CA) is in the system's centralized store. Adding
the certificate to Google Chrome is the easy method, but you can use any
method supported by your operating system.

The Python version embedded with #app uses its own built-in certificates
file, which stores root certificates for the most common certificate
authorities. But you can have Python use your self-signed certificate by
setting the path to the file in the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable.
