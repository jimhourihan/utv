= #pushapp <ch-rvpush>

The #pushapp command-line utility allows you to communicate with a running
#app (you can designate a "target" #app with the #inline-shell("-tag")
option). The help output from the command is as follows:

#let p = pushcmd
#code-block(lang: none,
    "usage: " + p + " [-tag <tag>] <command> <commandArgs>",
    "       " + p + " set <mediaArgs>",

Any number of media sources and associated per-source options can be
specified for the `set` and `merge` commands. For the `mu-eval` command, it's
probably best to put all your Mu code in a single quoted string.

If #pushapp cannot find a running #app to talk to, it'll start one with the
appropriate command-line options. Any later #raw(pushcmd) commands will use
this #app until it exits. Note that the #app that #pushapp starts will by
default be the one in the same `bin` directory. If you'd rather start a
different #app, or start a wrapper, etc, you can set the environment variable
`RVPUSH_RV_EXECUTABLE_PATH` to point to the one you'd prefer. If you want
#pushapp to never start #app, you can set this environment variable to
"none".
