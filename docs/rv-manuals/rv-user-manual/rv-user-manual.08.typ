= Using LUTs in #app <ch-luts>

Look up tables (LUTs) are useful for approximating complicated color
transforms, especially those which have no known precise mathematical
representation. #app provides four points in its color pipeline where LUTs
can be applied: just after reading the file and before caching (pre-cache
LUT, see @precache-lut), directly after the cache (file LUT), just before
display transforms (look LUT), and as one of the display transforms (display
LUT). The first three are per-source while there is only a single display
LUT for each #app session. See #xref(<rv-pixel-pipeline>)[Figure 7.1].

Each of the LUTs can be either a channel LUT or a 3D LUT (the difference is
explained in @channel-vs-3d-luts). In the case of a 3D LUT there can also be
an additional channel pre-LUT which can be used to shape the data. Both
types of LUT are preceded by an input matrix which can scale high dynamic
range data into the range of the LUT input (which is the range $[0, 1]$).
The values the LUT produces can be outside of the $[0, 1]$ range. This makes
it possible for any of the LUTs to transform colors outside of the typical
$[0, 1]$ range on both input and output.

Internally, #app will store the LUT as either half precision floating point
or 16 bit integral. Not all hardware is capable of processing LUTs stored as
floating point (esp. the 3D LUTs) so if you notice banding or noisy output
when using floating point LUT storage, you may have better luck with the 16
bit integral representation. If #app can determine whether the floating
point LUTs are usable itself it will default to whatever is appropriate.

When applied in hardware, the LUTs are interpolated when a value is not
exactly represented in the LUT. This is usually more of an issue with 3D
LUTs than channel LUTs since they have fewer samples per dimension. When
interpolating between sample values, #app uses linear interpolation for
channel LUTs and tri-linear interpolation for 3D LUTs.

There are a number of ways to create a LUT. For film look simulation, it's
often necessary to have special hardware to measure and compare film
recorder output. Alternately, you can use a lightbox; and assuming you have a
well calibrated neutral monitor, "eyeball" the LUT by comparing the film to
the monitor.

#app has two different algorithms for applying the LUTs on the GPU: using
floating point or fixed-point integer textures. Not all cards are equally
capable with 3D LUTs and floating point. If #app detects that the card
probably can't do a good job with the floating point hardware it will switch
to a fixed-point representation using 16 bit integer LUTs. Sometimes even
though the driver reports that the LUTs can be floating point, you will see
banding in the final images. If that occurs, try forcing the use of
fixed-point LUTs by turning off the Floating Point 3D LUTs item on the
Rendering tab of the preferences. The fixed point LUT algorithm will perform
just as well as floating point in 99% of normal use cases.

*To assign a LUT file to the source or display:* use the
#menu(("File", "Import")) menu to assign LUT files to either the source's
Look or File pipelines. LUT files can also be assigned to the Pre-Cache and
Display from the same menu.

== Channel (1D) versus 3D LUTs <channel-vs-3d-luts>

A channel LUT (also called a 1D LUT) has three independent look-up tables:
one each for the R, G and B channels. The alpha channel is not affected by
the channel LUT. Channel LUTs may be very high resolution with up to 4096
samples. Each entry in the channel LUT maps an input channel value to an
output channel value. The input values are in the $[0, 1]$ range, but the
output values are unbounded.

Channel LUTs differ from 3D LUTs in one critical way: they can only modify
channel values independently of one another. In other words, the output
value of the red channel can only be a result of the incoming red value. In
a 3D LUT, this is not the case: the output value of the red channel can be
dependent on any or all of the input red, green, and blue values. This is
sometimes called channel cross-talk.

The other important difference between channel and 3D LUTs is the number of
samples. Channel LUTs are one dimensional and therefore consume much less
memory than 3D LUTs. Because of this, channel LUTs can have more samples
per-channel than 3D LUTs.

The implication of all this is that channel LUTs are useful for representing
functions like gamma or log to linear which don't involve cross-talk between
channels whereas 3D LUTs are good for representing more general color
transforms and simulating physical output like film.

3D LUTs can be very memory intensive. A $64 times 64 times 64$ LUT requires
$64^3 times 3 times 4$ bytes of data (3 MB). You can quickly run out of
memory for your image on the graphics card by making the 3D LUT too big
(e.g. $128 times 128 times 128$ will slow #app down). #app does not require
the 3D LUT to have the same resolution in each dimension. You may find that
a particular LUT is smooth or nearly linear in one or more dimensions. In
that case you can use a lower resolution in those dimensions.

Some graphics cards have resolution issues with 3D textures which can cause
loss of precision when #app's 3D LUT feature is enabled. On older NVidia
cards and ATI cards in general, 3D textures may be limited to non-floating
point color representations. Precision loss when using a LUT can be
exacerbated by applying display gamma on these cards. To minimize precision
loss on those types of cards, bake monitor gamma and/or log-lin conversion
directly into the display LUT. With newer GPUs this is not as much of an
issue.

== Input Matrix and Pre-LUT

For HDR applications, the incoming data needs to be rescaled and possibly
shaped. #app has two separate components which do this: the LUT input matrix
and a channel pre-LUT. The input matrix is a general $4 times 4$ matrix. For
HDR pixels, the matrix is used to scale the incoming pixel to range
$[0, 1]$. The pre-LUT, the channel LUT, and the 3D LUT all take inputs in
that range. @lut-components shows a diagram of the channel and 3D LUT
components and their input and output ranges.

The pre-LUT is identical to the channel LUT in implementation. It maps single
channel values to new values. Unlike the general channel LUT, the pre-LUT
must always map values in the $[0, 1]$ range into the same range. The
purpose of the pre-LUT is to condition the data before it's transformed by
the 3D LUT.

For example, it may make sense for 3D LUT input values to be in a non-linear
space -- like log space. If the incoming pixels are linear they need to be
transformed to log before the 3D LUT is applied. By using a relatively high
resolution pre-LUT the data can be transformed into that space without
precision loss.

== The Pre-Cache LUT <precache-lut>

The first LUT that the pixels can be transformed by is the pre-cache LUT.
This LUT has the same parameters and features as the other LUTs, but it is
applied before the cache. The pre-cache LUT is currently applied by the CPU
(not on the GPU) whereas the file, look, and display LUTs are all used by
the graphics hardware directly. For this reason the pre-cache LUT is
slightly slower than the others.

The pre-cache LUT is useful when a special caching format is desired. For
example by using the pre-cache LUT and the color bit depth formatting, you
can have #app convert linear OpenEXR data into 8 bit integer format in log
space. By using #app's log to linear conversion on the cached 8 bit data you
can effectively store high dynamic range data (albeit limited range) and get
double the number of frames into the cache. Many encoding schemes are
possible by coupling a custom pre-cache LUT, change of bit depth, and the
hardware file LUT to decode on the card.

) <lut-formats>

#app supports several of the common LUT file formats (see @lut-formats).
Unfortunately, not all LUT formats are equally capable and some of them are
not terribly well defined. In most cases, you need to know the intended use
of a particular LUT file. For example, it doesn't make sense to apply a LUT
file which expects the incoming pixels to be in Kodak Log space to pixels
from an EXR file (which is typically in a linear space). Often there is no
way to tell the intended usage of a LUT file other than its file name or
possibly comments in the file itself. Most formats do not have a public
mechanism to indicate the usage to an application.

To complicate matters, many LUT files are intended to map directly from the
pixels in a particular file format directly to your monitor. When using these
types of LUTs in #app you should be aware that making any changes to the
color using #app's color corrections or display corrections will not produce
expected results (because you are operating on pixels in the color space
appropriate for the display, rather than in linear space).

One of the more common types of LUT files you are likely to come across is
one which maps Kodak Log space to sRGB display space. The file name of that
kind of LUT might be `log2sRGB` or something similar. A variation on that
same type of LUT might include an additional component that simulates the
look of the pixels when projected from a particular type of film stock.
Strictly speaking, you do not need to use log to sRGB LUTs with #app because
it implements these functions itself (and they are exact, not approximated).
So ideally, if you require film output simulation you have a LUT which only
does that one transform. Of course this is often not the case; the world of
LUT formats is a complicated one.

=== RSR .csp LUT Format

Currently, the best LUT format for use with #app is the #inline-shell(".csp")
format. This format handles high dynamic range input and output as well as
non-linear and linear pre-LUTs. It maps most closely to #app's internal LUT
functions.

There is one type of #inline-shell(".csp") file which #app does not handle:
a channel LUT with a non-linear pre-LUT. This is probably a very rare beast
since an equivalent 1D LUT can be created with a linear pre-LUT. An error
will occur if you attempt to use a channel LUT with a non-linear pre-LUT.

When #app reads a pre-LUT from this file format and it can determine that the
pre-LUT is linear, it will convert the pre-LUT into a matrix and apply it as
the LUT input matrix. In that case the non-linear channel pre-LUT is not
needed. If the pre-LUT is non-linear (in any channel) #app will construct a
channel LUT which is used just before the 3D LUT. Input values in the
#inline-shell(".csp") pre-LUT are normalized and the scaling is then moved
to the input matrix. Using a matrix when possible frees up resources for
other LUTs and images in the GPU. Any pre-LUT in a #inline-shell(".csp")
file with only two values is by definition a linear pre-LUT.

2
0 13.5
0 1
2
0 13.5
0 1
2
0 13.5
0 1

...
```)

In the above listing, lines 4 through 12 (one two-entry pre-LUT for each of
R, G and B) are linear pre-LUT values. In this case the pre-LUT values are
mapping values in the range $[0, 13.5]$ down to $[0, 1]$ for processing by a
3D LUT (which is not shown). For a summary of the RSR #inline-shell(".csp")
format see #xref(<app-csp-format>)[Appendix G].

For the most part, it's not necessary to know the distinction between a
linear and non-linear pre-LUT in the file. However, the behavior of the
pre-LUT outside the bounds of its largest and smallest input values will be
different for linear pre-LUTs. Since the pre-LUT is represented as a matrix,
it will not clamp values outside the specified range. Non-linear pre-LUTs
will clamp values.
