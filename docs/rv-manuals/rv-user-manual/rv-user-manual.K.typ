= Localizing Media Paths with RV_OS_PATH or RV_PATHSWAP <app-path-localization>

== RV_OS_PATH Variables

`RV_OS_PATH` variables work similarly to `RV_PATHSWAP` variables, but they
can be used to adjust paths of media files (and LUTs etc) that are more
arbitrary, and are specifically targeted at supporting multi-OS
environments.

For example, if your site supports Linux/Windows/macOS machines, and the same
basic file system structure appears on all OSs but at different roots,
setting a group of three environment variables on all machines will allow
some interoperability. Suppose you have the following three "roots" under
which your directory structure is identical on all OSs:

#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: left,
    table.header[*OS*][*Root*],
    [macOS], `/shows`,
    [Linux], `/net/shows`,
    [Windows], `c:/shows`,
)

Then if you can ensure that all users have the following environment
variables set, paths will automatically be converted on input to #app:

#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: left,
    table.header[*Variable Name*][*Variable Value*],
    `RV_OS_PATH_OSX`, `/shows`,
    `RV_OS_PATH_LINUX`, `/net/shows`,
    `RV_OS_PATH_WINDOWS`, `c:/shows`,
)

For example if #app is running on Windows and receives a path like
`/net/shows/sw4/trailer.mov` it will convert it to `c:/shows/sw4/trailer.mov`
before use. (*Note:* UNC paths are also supported.)

If some of your production data appears in a separate hierarchy, you can add
additional variables to support exceptions. For example, suppose that all
show data is stored as above, but reference data is stored separately under
these "roots":

#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: left,
    table.header[*OS*][*Root*],
    [macOS], `/ref`,
    [Linux], `/net/reference`,
    [Windows], `c:/global/reference`,
)

In that case, you can set another triplet of environment variables to allow
for that exception:

#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: left,
    table.header[*Variable Name*][*Variable Value*],
    `RV_OS_PATH_OSX_REF`, `/ref`,
    `RV_OS_PATH_LINUX_REF`, `/net/reference`,
    `RV_OS_PATH_WINDOWS_REF`, `c:/global/reference`,
)

Some additional details about `RV_OS_PATH` variables:

- If you only use two different OSs, you only need to specify the
  corresponding pairs of environment variables.
- As above, additional sets of environment variables are considered to refer
  to the same "root" if the portion following the OS name matches (`REF` in
  the above example).
- You can set any number of sets of environment variables.
- `RV_OS_PATH` variables affect all incoming filenames *except* those which
  contain `RV_PATHSWAP` variables.
- `RV_OS_PATH` variables do not affect outgoing filenames.
- If more than one match is found, the variable that matches the largest
  number of characters in the incoming path will be used.

    author #a-app package to handle transforming your paths with the
    `incoming-source-path` event (see the #app Reference Manual).

== RV_PATHSWAP Variables

If you're comfortable with environment variables, `RV_PATHSWAP` variables can
provide a way to share session files across platforms and/or studio
locations.

#quote(block: true)[
    *Note:* Due to the difficult nature of changing file paths, we do not
    recommend `RV_PATHSWAP` variables unless absolutely necessary.
]

Suppose that you're working on a project called 'myshow' in two locations,
but with shared or mirrored data. Location 'Win' is Windows-based and at that
location all the media lives in paths that have names that start with
`\\projects\myshow`. The other location, 'Lin', is Linux-based and at that
site all the media for myshow appears in paths that start with
`/shows/myshow`.

To localize the media you can define a site-wide environment variable in each
location called `RV_PATHSWAP_MYSHOW`, but with the corresponding value for
that site.

At location 'Lin':

#code-block(lang: none, "RV_PATHSWAP_MYSHOW = \"/shows/myshow\"")

And at location 'Win':

#code-block(lang: none, "RV_PATHSWAP_MYSHOW = \"//projects/myshow\"")

(Note the forward slashes in the above Windows path. The PATHSWAP variables
operate on internal #app paths, and at this point backward slashes have been
converted to forward slashes.)

You can have any number of these variables (they just all need to start with
`RV_PATHSWAP_`) so you could have one per show, for example. But note that if
the above path pattern holds for all your projects, you can localize them all
at once with variables like this one:

#code-block(lang: none, "RV_PATHSWAP_ROOT = \"/shows\"")

Once #app is running in an environment with these variables, it'll look for
them in incoming paths (in session files, on the command line, in rvlink
URLs, etc), and add them to paths it writes into session files (and network
packets between synchronized instances).

The up-shot is that a session file written at either site can be read at
either site, and a sync session between sites can refer to the same media
with the appropriate path for that site.

And of course these same benefits apply to using #app at a single site, but
on several different platforms.

== Hand-written Session Files or RVLINK URLs

If you're writing your own session files to feed to #app "by hand", note
that the format #app expects is something like this:

#code-block(lang: none, "string movie = \"${RV_PATHSWAP_MYSHOW}/myseq/myshot/mymov.mov\"")

Similarly, a URL to play that media could look like:

#code-block(lang: none, "rvlink://${RV_PATHSWAP_MYSHOW}/myseq/myshot/mymov.mov")

== Remote Sync

#app automatically swaps the values of appropriate PATHSWAP variables in and
out of the names of media transmitted across a sync connection, so once you
have them set up, these variables can also make Remote Sync seamless across
sites or platforms.
